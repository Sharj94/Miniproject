## Miniproject

#Project Background
The client required an app that they could utilise to complete all the business requirements behind the scenes of a pop-up coffee shop. We were drip fed the evolving requirements for the CLI application in python by the client over the course of 6 weeks which were implemented as required. 

#Client requirements
  
  Week 1:
  The initial requirements that were given by the client included creating a product, adding, deleting, and updating the product in a list. Additionally, the requirements inncluded the ability to view all the products that belonged to the list.
  
  Week 2:
  The client needs evolved and they now required the app to be able to create, view, and manipulate orders in addition to the product. Additionally the product was to be in the form strings and list of strings. The orders, on the other hand, were required to be a list of dictionaries. 
  
  Week 3:
  During this week the client specified that they needed to persist the data for orders and products in .txt form. They needed to be able to update the status of orders. They needed to be able to load the data when the application was started and saved at the closing of it. 
  
  Week 4:
  The client now needed the data to be persisted in .csv form for all three components of the app; couriers, orders and products. The client also needed for all of the data to be in the form of a dictionary and be persisted as a list of dictionaries. 
  
  Week 5 and 6 (tbc):
  The client now requires the application to utilise databases and sort orders by couriers and items.
  
# How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?

In order to ensure that the requirements of the projects were fully met, all of the updates were completed as and when needed. I ensured that I checked off the provided points whenever they were published. 

# How did you guarantee the project's requirements?

The projects requirements were guranteed through the use unit testing throughout the core functionality of the application. This was done to ensure that the client receives 

# If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?



# What did you most enjoy implementing?
